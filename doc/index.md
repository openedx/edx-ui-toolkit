# Welcome to the edX UI Toolkit!

The edX UI Toolkit is the visual, UI, and front end style guide for edX's applications.

This library contains the following:

* Backbone views to implement patterns as defined by the [edX Pattern Library](http://ux.edx.org).
* Utility methods to simplify the creation and testing of user interfaces.

The edX UI Toolkit is an open source library that is hosted on [GitHub]({{ site.data.edx-ui-toolkit.url_github }}).
You can also read more on the [edX Front End Development wiki](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FEDX/).
